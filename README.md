# 401k_prediction_knn

This is my first Github Project. This project was inspired from the Data School video series on SciKit-learn. From that ten-part series I recreate and later build off of what I learned using my own data on 401k participation.
The goal of this project is to recreate what I learned from that video series. The steps of the project include three different methods used in the video series:
1.	Linear Regression 
1.	Model Training - Train and test
2.	linear regression
3.	Interpretting the model
4.	making predictions
5.	Evaluate metrics
6.	Cross-validation - feature selection
2.	KNN 
1.	Model Training
2.	Model Evaluation
3.	Cross-validation 
1.	K fold Cross validation: parameter tuning using GridSearchCV
4.	Model Evaluation
5.	Compare Train/test Split w/ kfold
6.	Evaluate results
3.	Logit regression 
1.	Model Training
2.	Model Evaluation
3.	Cross-validation 
1.	K fold Cross validation: parameter tuning using GridSearchCV
4.	Model Evaluation
5.	Compare Train/test Split w/ kfold
6.	Evaluate results
4.	Cross-Validation: model selection
This is to build confidence and showcase my ability to use python for data science. All operations were done in a Jupyter Notebook.
