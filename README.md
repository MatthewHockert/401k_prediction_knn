# 401k_prediction_knn_Sci-Kit Learn

This is my first Github Project. This project was inspired from the Data School video series on SciKit-learn. From that ten-part series I recreate and later build off of what I learned using my own data on 401k participation.
The goal of this project is to recreate what I learned from that video series. The steps of the project include three different methods used in the video series:
1.	Linear Regression 
        Model Training - Train and test
        linear regression
        Interpretting the model
        making predictions
        Evaluate metrics
        Cross-validation - feature selection
2.	KNN 
        Model Training
        Model Evaluation
        Cross-validation 
            K fold Cross validation: parameter tuning using GridSearchCV
        Model Evaluation
        Compare Train/test Split w/ kfold
        Evaluate results
3.	Logit regression 
        Model Training
        Model Evaluation
        Cross-validation 
            K fold Cross validation: parameter tuning using GridSearchCV
        Model Evaluation
        Compare Train/test Split w/ kfold
        Evaluate results
4.	Cross-Validation: model selection

This is to build confidence and showcase my ability to use python for data science. 
All operations were done in a Jupyter Notebook.
